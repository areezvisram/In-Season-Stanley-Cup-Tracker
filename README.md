# In Season Stanley Cup Tracker
### On the 32 Thoughts Podcast, they discussed an "In Season Stanley Cup" competition for the upcoming NHL Season. I was intrigued by the idea but realized there was no website made to track the winner. So I decided to make one myself.
**Disclaimer**: All credit for the idea goes to the 32 Thoughts Podcast. This project does not claim to have conceived the idea, it was just made as a tool to track it.

## **Competition Overview**
How does the competition work?
- To start the season, the current champion is the Tampa Bay Lightning
- Whichever team beats them first become the current champion
- The next team to beat that team become the current champion, and so on, until the end of the season where the current champion is crowned the In Season Stanley Cup winner

## **Features**
- Make a selection for who you think will be the winner and come back at any time to view your pick compared to the current champion at the time
- View the history of the competition throughout the season to see how the current champion came to be


## **Updates in Development**
- Champion for number of days tracker. Another element to the competition where the team who is champion for the most amount of days throughout the season is the winner
- Live draft with friends. Create leagues with friends and live draft which teams you think will win, and keep a score throughout the season to see who wins

## Creation
- Frontend created with ReactJS, CSS, hosted on Netlify
- Firebase database
